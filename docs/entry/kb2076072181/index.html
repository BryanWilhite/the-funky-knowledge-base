<p>One of the things you want to avoid when deploying an ASP.NET application into production is to accidentally (or deliberately) leave the &lt;compilation debug=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; switch on within the application’s web.config file.</p>
<p>Doing so causes a number of non-optimal things to happen including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The compilation of ASP.NET pages takes longer (since some batch optimizations are disabled)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code can execute slower (since some additional debug paths are enabled)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much more memory is used within the application at runtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scripts and images downloaded from the WebResources.axd handler are not cached</p>
</li>
</ol>
